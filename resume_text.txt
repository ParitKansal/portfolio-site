PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
XELPMOC DESIGN AND TECH LTD. | Machine Learning Scientist
January 2025 – Present | Hyderabad, India
• Live Store Analysis: Contibuted in builting a CCTV-based
real-time store monitoring system for a major global fast-food
chain, analyzing live RTSP feeds to detect customer entry/exit,
staff presence at counters, and triggering alerts when customers
wait too long unattended. Implemented automatic detection of
unclean tables after customer departure and dustbin cleanliness,
generating manager alerts. Deployed using a microservice-based
backend for continuous live processing.
• Intelligent Document Understanding: Fine-tuned DONUT for
conditional key–value extraction from insurance claims, achieving
98% field-level accuracy. Developed a Gemma-3-4B (4-bit
VLM) automated judge to validate predictions against the original
document image, reaching 96.67% document-level accuracy.
The production pipeline processes 100,000+ documents monthly.
• Integrated Lead Scoring Model: Built an event-level scoring
pipeline to predict post–site visit likelihood by integrating
WhatsApp, web, and audio interactions. Engineered cumulative
behavioral features for each event and trained a ModernBERT
model on interaction transitions, using its outputs as features in a
final XGBoost model, achieving 83% recall in the top 13% events.
• Web Visit Scoring: Designed an end-to-end scoring pipeline to
address a 2+ month feedback delay. Analyzed 8M+ sessions using
XGBoost, achieving 88% session-level recall and 90%
visitor-level recall.
• Multi-Document Detection: Developed a synthetic document
generation pipeline to train a Mask R-CNN model for
multi-document detection, achieving 97.1% AP@[IoU=0.50:0.95].
ACADEMIC PROJECTS
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF RECOMMENDATION
ALGORITHMS | Machine Learning
June 2024
Benchmarked SVD, SVD++, KNN, RBM, and AutoRec models on
RMSE, Hit Rate, and Novelty, providing a comprehensive performance
comparison.
QUESTION PAIR SIMILARITY DETECTION | NLP
October 2023
Developed a duplicate question detection model on the 400K+ Quora
dataset using Optuna-based hyperparameter tuning, achieving 83.7%
accuracy.
RESEARCH PROJECTS
Few-Shot Layout Detection (In Progress)
Building a few-shot document layout detection model that generalizes
layout understanding from a limited set of annotated exemplars. For
instance, when a user provides bounding boxes around headings in a few
sample images, the model learns the visual and spatial characteristics of
those regions and predicts the corresponding heading boundaries in
unseen documents.
